What is your site's primary purpose?
The primary purpose of my site is to actively allow me to learn HTML and CSS by doing, and gain an understanding of website structure and coding concepts.

Who is your target audience?
For now the target audience is myself and members of my cohort. In future I can see the target audience being prospective employers or clients.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I want visitors to either be able to interact with my site on either desktop or mobile devices. I would like the user experience to be easy and intuitive. 

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
I plan to use simple and obvious clickable blog titles on the index page to allow users to easily navigate the site. I will make sure that text remains readable on the mobile version and that the menu is still easy to navigate on small devices.
