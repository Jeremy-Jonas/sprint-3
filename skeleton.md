When the browser is resized to less than 550px the layout of the website changes to a more mobile friendly design. The biggest example would be the text and the images of the phone, when above 550px they are side by side and the image grows/shrinks to fit, however when resized to below 550px the image is moved underneath the text to enable both the text and image to remain large enough to read on a mobile screen.
